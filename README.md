```html
<script>
  var fn = function(){};
  pass.throttle(fn, 500, { leading: false });
</script>
```

### 2. Trailing

#### Debounce
If `trailing` is set to a value other than boolean `false`, it will fire at the last edge of the event.

```html
<script>
  var fn = function(){};
  pass.debounce(fn, 500, { leading: true, trailing: true });
</script>
```

#### Throttle
If `trailing` is set to a value other than boolean `false`, it will fire at the trailing edge of the event.

```html
<script>

  pass.throttle(fn, 500, { leading: false, trailing: true });
